## ü§ñ How to Create Your Telegram Bot

### Step 1: Create the Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**.
2. Start a conversation and send `/newbot`.
3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Give your bot a name (e.g., `ScreenshotAnswerBot`)
   - Assign a username (must end in `bot`, e.g., `screenshot_answer_bot`)
4. Once created, BotFather will provide you a **Bot Token**:

```
Example token:
8014853991:AAF...dfc
```

Paste this token into the script here:

```python
BOT_TOKEN = 'your_bot_token_here'
```


### Step 2: Get Your Chat ID

1. Start a chat with your bot in Telegram.
2. Send any message (e.g., `/start`).
3. Visit this URL in your browser (replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN):

```
https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates
```

4. Find your **chat ID** in the JSON response. It will look like this:

```
"chat":{"id":XXXXXXXXXX,...}
```

5. Paste the chat ID into the script:

```python
CHAT_ID = 'your_chat_id_here'
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Make sure you configure these variables in your Python script:

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="your_openai_api_key")
BOT_TOKEN = 'your_telegram_bot_token'
CHAT_ID = 'your_chat_id'
```

The default screenshot folder is:
